                  Hi there my name is Chloe Platt and I am a self-taught,
                  freelance{" "}
                  <span className="font-bold underline">artist&nbsp;</span>
                  and <span className="font-bold underline">illustrator</span>
                  &nbsp;based in Norwich aiming to create unique pieces for
                  friends, family and customers to treasure forever. I work with
                  a variety of mediums, including pencil, ink, wax and acrylic
                  paint, on different bases, such as canvas, cardboard and paper
                  to produce different textures and results.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I take inspiration from nature, animals and the human form,
                  and especially love painting manâ€™s best friend, dogs. I am
                  open to taking commissions for custom, one-off projects and
                  have previously produced portraits of pets for customers. If
                  you would like to work with me on a commission, please send me
                  an email and I hope you enjoy browsing through my work.
                </p>
